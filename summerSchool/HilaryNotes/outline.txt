1. The Navier-Stokes Equations
2. Finite Differences

Practical 1: Choose a term from the RHS of the NS equations and write a code to solve the rate of change = that term (in 1d or 0d). Give some examples, eg linear or non-linear advection.

3. Analysis of Accuracy and Stability

Practical 2: Implement a better numerical method

4. Dispersion and Staggered Grids

Practical 3: Increase the complexity of your code, for example in one of the following ways:

a) Make it 2d
b) Make it non-linear
c) Add another term
d) Solve a system of equations (eg SWE)
e) Use a non-uniform grid
f) Use an implicit solution

5. Semi-implicit solution of wave equtaions (probably not included)
