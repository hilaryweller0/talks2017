\section{Practical: Implement a Better Numerical Method }

For this practical you have two choices:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement a better numerical method for the equation you were solving
in the first practical
\item Solve a different equation using a sensibly chosen numerical method
\end{enumerate}
There are many possibilities:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If you are solving an advection equation, you might like to consider
using one of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A monotonic advection scheme
\item Semi-Lagrangian advection
\item The Lax-Wendroff method
\end{enumerate}
\item Compare explicit and implicit time-stepping.
\item You might like to consider using Runge-Kutta time-stepping
\item You might like to increase the order of accuracy of the spatial discretisation
\item If you are solving the shallow water equations

\begin{enumerate}
\item Try adding non-linear terms
\item Try using a different Arakawa grid
\end{enumerate}
\item Try using variable spatial resolution or adaptive time-stepping
\end{enumerate}
You should search online for ideas of a numerical method to use. You
can also refer to my MSc teaching notes:\\
