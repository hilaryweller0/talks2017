\section{Practical: Solving a Differential Equation using Finite Differences}

This practical is completely open ended and we will build on it during
the week. Everyone has different knowledge and experience coding numerical
methods so during this practical you will choose your own equation
to solve and choose or design a numerical method to solve it. If you
have not coded numerical methods before, you might like to start with
the one dimensional linear advection equation and make modifications
to the code in section \ref{sec:CTCScode}. For the more adventurous,
you could choose an equation that you are interested in or pick a
couple of terms from one of the Navier-Stokes equations to model.
Please discuss your decisions with the staff. Also feel free to find
equations and numerical methods online. Some equations that you might
like to consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item The non-linear advection equation (Burger's equation)
\item The linear or non-linear shallow-water equations
\item The diffusion equation (easier than the linear advection equation)
\item An equation representing the motion of a pendulum (also potentially
easy)
\end{itemize}
You will probably learn most if you stick with one dimensional equations. 

You will have an opportunity at the end of the practical to tell the
rest of the class what equation you have chosen, how you have chosen
to solve it and if you have any results or problems so far. %
