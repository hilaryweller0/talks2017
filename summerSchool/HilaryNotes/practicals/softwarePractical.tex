\section{Practical: Use Some of the Software Techniques Described}
\begin{enumerate}
\item On the use of \url{git}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a local \url{git} repository. Put your work so far into your
local repository, as described in section \ref{sec:git}.
\item Create an account on \url{https://github.com/} 
\item Create a repository on \url{https://github.com/} and link the local
and remote repositories
\item Try out everything as described in section \ref{sec:git}.
\item Find some information on \url{git} online and try out some different
things
\end{enumerate}
\item Code design: Think how you can re-design your code in order to conform
to the guidance in section \ref{sec:goodCode}. Can you pull any code
out of the main code into a function in order to clarify, avoid code
duplication and shorten the main code? Is there any related data that
is always passed around together? Should this be combined into a data
structure such as a class?
\item Testing: Use a function that you have already written or write a function,
for example, to find the roots of a quadratic equation. Write tests
to test that this function behaves as expected for a range of different
inputs and outputs. Test situations in which the function should fail
as well as situations where it should not fail. I would recommend
researching a python testing module such as \url{unittest} to help
with your testing.%
