I am interested in registering for this workshop. I am working on conditional averaging for cumulus parametrisation (in collaboration with John Thuburn, Bob Plant, Chris Holloway and Peter Clark) and I would be keen to give a talk about this work. The website doesn't say anything about whether you will be accepting contributed talks. Please let me know.
